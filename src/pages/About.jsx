        <p>
          After graduating from University Caroline Condon was Head of Customer 
          Services and The Call Centre Manager for Artigiano, an exclusive mail 
          order clothing company specialising in luxury Italian fashion for women. 
          It was here that Caroline learnt the importance of listening to the 
          client. With a huge desire to make her own way in business, Caroline 
          became a partner in Beauchamp Bureau of Knightsbridge in 2000. After 
          eleven years of successful recruitment within private households she 
          founded her own company, Caroline Condon Recruitment in 2011.

          Caroline strongly believes in a personal service. Understanding 
          individual job roles and how each household functions is paramount and 
          therefore she only putâ€™s together a selection of suitable, quality 
          candidates for interview. Caroline also believes in looking after her 
          candidates and getting to know them so she knows who suits which role. 
          She has a great working relationship with them so as an agency, always 
          has a large pool to draw from. Caroline and her team have spent a lot of 
          time creating a network of staff that allows them to offer a worldwide 
          service that still has that personal touch.
